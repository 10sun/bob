========================================
 Contributing to the |project| Project
========================================

We're really glad you'd like to join the |project| team!
To make a contribution to |project|, we suggest you follow this procedure:

1. Fork the |project| git repository following the GitHub instructions here: `Fork A Repo`_

2. Make your changes and/or implement new functionality following the guide: :doc:`Development`

3. Ensure that your code:
  
  * follows the coding guidelines (see :ref:`section-python-coding-guidelines` and :ref:`section-cxx-coding-guidelines`)

  * compiles without problems!

  * is accompanied by extensive documentation.

  * is accompanied by unit tests. New code is not acceptable otherwise. If you are contributing a bug fix, you should supply a new unit test that fails before applying the fix and passes after applying the fix.

4. Make a pull request following the GitHub instructions here: `Send pull requests`_. 
   
Making a pull request will send your contribution to the |project| project maintainers, who will review the contribution and decide whether to pull it into the official |project| git repository.

Thanks for contributing to |project|!
