* pybob_visioner does not seem to depend correctly on bob_visioner. If the
  build is run in parallel, it normally fails.
* installation remains untested
* the macro bob_python_tag_build (using configure_file) does not work as
  expected. Sometimes it fills the right values, sometimes it does not.
* Remove all group writing (chmod) flags from installation, leave this to the
  build system
* Example installation requires specific macro
* face_verification python package not migrated to new infrastructure
* Up to now, now way to make MacOSX builds load the python libraries and
  compiled python modules w/o placing a DYLD_PATH on the environment - may be
  have to understand how OSX frameworks work?
* database creation, installation and copying still executed as test - a good
  thing would be to have independent targets for this. Problems to solve:
  testing db functionality will not work?
* Installation:
  * after installation, bindings dependant on _core_array.so cannot find it if
    the DYLD_PATH is not set to include the python2.6/bob/core/array path.
  * have not verified if we can still compile C++ external code against Bob. A
    recipe is required somewhere.
