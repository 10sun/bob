Installing Bob
--------------

This document briefly describes how to install Bob on a generic platform. For
platform-specific details and pre-compiled binaries, please consult our website
at http://idiap.github.com/bob/.

1. Dependencies
---------------

Bob depends on:

 * Blitz++
 * Lapack
 * Python
 * Boost
 * NumPy
 * Scipy
 * Matplotlib
 * fftw
 * SQLAlchemy
 * ImageMagick
 * HDF5
 * argparse

There are also optional dependencies we strongly recommend:

 * FFMpeg
 * MatIO
 * Qt4
 * VLFeat
 * OpenCV
 * LIBSVM

Building and documentation generation depends on the following packages:

 * CMake
 * Sphinx
 * Doxygen
 * Dvipng

2. Building
-----------

Once you have built and installed all dependencies locally, you should use
CMake to build Bob itself. From your shell, do:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make

3. Testing
----------

Tests can be executed with:

$ make test
$ make sphinx-doctest

4. Installing
-------------

Just execute:

$ make install

5. Influential CMake variables
------------------------------

Some variables that may be handy:

 * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: options "Release" or "Debug" are supported
 * CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: places to look-up for externals such as the dependencies
   listed above
 * WITH_PYTHON: if you would like to force a specific version of python, you
   can define it with this variable
