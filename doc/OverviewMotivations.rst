 Motivations
*************

We designed and released |project| for the following main reasons:

* Need of a software platform where stable algorithms and common tools used for research purposes can be put at.

* Thoroughly tested at every minor change: correctness above speed

* Easy way to reproduce published results

* Environment that allows fast pace development, with throw-away prototypes

* Ability to implement fast versions (in `C++`_) of identified bottlenecks

* Re-use existing open-source packages and standards

* Open source (`GPL-3.0`_) with hopes it is useful to others. (For more information on licensing, please visit our :doc:`BobLicensing`)
