* pybob_visioner does not seem to depend correctly on bob_visioner. If the
  build is run in parallel, it normally fails.
* the macro bob_python_tag_build (using configure_file) does not work as
  expected. Sometimes it fills the right values, sometimes it does not.
* Remove all group writing (chmod) flags from installation, leave this to the
  build system
* Example installation requires specific macro
* face_verification python package not migrated to new infrastructure
* database creation, installation and copying still executed as test - a good
  thing would be to have independent targets for this. Problems to solve:
  testing db functionality will not work?
* Installation:
  * have not verified if we can still compile C++ external code against Bob. A
    recipe is required somewhere.
  * installation remains untested
* OpenCV installation not found on MacOSX
* Documentation generation still not tackled after build modifications
