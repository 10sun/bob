Things to consider:

* io.arrayset.cat is not implemented
* io.video subsystem is missing
* io.codec tests are missing

Modifications on the syntax:

* io.Arrayset.get() returns io.Array's while operator[] returns NumPy ndarrays
* core.array.load() an core.array.save() supressed. Use io.load() and io.save()
  to directly load numpy ndarrays to memory or save them.
* All operations called directly on blitz::Array's that were done in Python
  need to be migrated to a NumPy equivalent, if necessary. Here is an example:

  Before: a.tanh()
  After: numpy.tanh(a)

  There are operations that don't need migration such as sum() or mean() as
  NumPy also implements them on the ndarray object.
