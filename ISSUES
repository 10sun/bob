* pybob_visioner does not seem to depend correctly on bob_visioner. If the
  build is run in parallel, it normally fails.
* installation remains untested
* the macro bob_python_tag_build (using configure_file) does not work as
  expected. Sometimes it fills the right values, sometimes it does not.
* Remove all group writing (chmod) flags from installation, leave this to the
  build system
* Example installation requires specific macro
* face_verification python package not migrated to new infrastructure
