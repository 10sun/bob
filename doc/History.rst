History
-------

|project| has distant roots on `Torch 3 vision`_, a variant of `Torch`_, a
framework for machine learning, initially developed at the Idiap Research
Institute in Martigny, Wallis, Switzerland. It diverged from `Torch`_ in its
early infancy to become a completely independent project, focused primarily on
tools for Biometrics and Forensics, Machine Learning and Signal Processing.
Here are some links to older versions of ``Torch`` that certain served as an
inspiration:

* `Torch 3`_
* `Torch 3 Vision`_
* `Torch 5`_
