Installation Instructions
=========================

Requirements
============

* Cmake, version 2.8 at least
* Lapack
* Cblas/Atlas
* Python/Boost.Python (tested with Boost-1.34)

Installation
============

To build and install extras + torch in release mode

$ ./release.sh

In debug mode:

$ ./debug.sh

To re-start from scratch:

$ ./mrproper.sh

In order to work, you start by either calling "release.sh" or "debug.sh" to
build a release full operational release of torch. After that, you can build
either a single example or multiple examples:

To, for example, build/install the "gmm" example in "release" mode:

$ ./release.sh gmm

To build/install the "fdvideo" example in debug mode:

$ ./debug.sh fdvideo

To build/install all torch5 examples:

$ ./release.sh all-examples

So, to completely build from scratch, all examples and get them installed, one
just needs this command:

$ ./release.sh all-examples
