Things to consider:

* move io::buffer and io::typeinfo => core
* create a class called tp::ndarray that inherits from both core::buffer and
  bp::object and is automatically converted to and from python. Accumulate on
  this class all NumPy ndarray functionality for copying and extracting
  information in a safe way.
* io.arrayset.cat is not implemented
* io.video subsystem is missing
* io.codec tests are missing

Modifications on the syntax:

* io.Arrayset.get() returns io.Array's while operator[] returns NumPy ndarrays

* core.array.load() an core.array.save() supressed. Use io.load() and io.save()
  to directly load numpy ndarrays to memory or save them.
