Welcome to the |project| developers community!

First, we suggest you subscribe to the official |project| developers mailing list, by sending an email to: ``bob-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com``. This mailing list is focused on the development of |project| with an emphasis on:

1. A place to start discussing potential issues/bugs
2. Problems compiling or deploying |project|
3. Problems with |project| build or documentation infrastructure
4. Plans for next releases

In the following sections of this Developer's Guide we will describe the important aspects of |project| development that you should know about, including :ref:`compiling the code <section-compilation>`, :ref:`implementing new functionality <section-development>` or :ref:`fixing bugs <section-ticketreporting>`, and :ref:`contributing back to the community <section-contributing>`.

Thanks for joining and we hope to hear from you soon.

The |project| developers.
