Python coding guidelines
------------------------

* Try to follow `The Google Python Style Guide`_
* Class names usually start with an upper-case character and use CamelCase to 
  combine words. Function names (global functions or public class methods) start 
  with a lower-case character and words are combined\_with\_underscores. If you
  have private functions, please assure that they start with an underscore.
