Things to consider:

* io.arrayset.cat is not implemented
* io.video subsystem is missing
* io.codec tests are missing

Modifications on the syntax:

* io.Arrayset.get() returns io.Array's while operator[] returns NumPy ndarrays
* core.array.load() an core.array.save() supressed. Use io.load() and io.save()
  to directly load numpy ndarrays to memory or save them.
* All operations called directly on blitz::Array's that were done in Python
  need to be migrated to a NumPy equivalent, if necessary. Here is an example:

  Before: a.tanh()
  After: numpy.tanh(a)

  There are operations that don't need migration such as sum() or mean() as
  NumPy also implements them on the ndarray object.
* The construction torch.core.array.*.convert() is deprecated: use
  torch.core.convert(array...)
* The construction torch.core.array.numeq() is depreated: use
  numpy.array_equal(a, b)
* For array constructions:
  numpy.ndarray(shape, type) -- uninitialzed numpy ndarray
  numpy.zeros(shape, type)
  numpy.ones(shape, type)
  ...
  numpy.array(array_like, type) -- with specific initialization
* Array extents:

  Before: x.extent(0)
  After: x.shape[0]
