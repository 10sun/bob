To build the debian packages do the following:

$ fakeroot debian/rules clean 
$ dpkg-checkbuilddeps
$ fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -b

This will only build the binary package as a test. To build all packages,
including the source package, do the following:

$ fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage

The work of building a package with dpkg-buildpackage can take some iterations.
Here are some tips to alleviate common problems:

1. To enable multiple processes when building:

	$ fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -j4

2. To avoid cleaning before re-building:

	$ fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -nc

	Note that, otherwise, dpkg-buildpackage will first call clean.

3. To avoid signing the package (if you have a gpg key)

	$ fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

4.
