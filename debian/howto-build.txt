To build the debian packages do the following:

$ debuild clean
$ dpkg-checkbuilddeps
$ debuild -us -uc -b

This will only quickly build the binary package as a test. To build all
packages, including the source package, do the following:

$ debuild --no-tgz-check -kA2170D5D -I.git -I.gitignore -I.gitmodules 

To only build the source package (for a PPA upload for instance). Replace the
"-kValue" by your own PPA key identifier (can be obtained with the command
`gpg --list-keys`):

$ debuild --no-tgz-check -kA2170D5D -I.git -I.gitignore -I.gitmodules -S

The work of building a package with debuild can take some iterations.
Here are some tips to alleviate common problems:

1. To enable multiple processes when building:

	$ debuild -j4

2. To avoid cleaning before re-building (this will only rebuild the binary
   packages and not the source one):

	$ debuild -nc

	Note that, otherwise, debuild will first call clean.

3. To avoid signing the package (if you have a gpg key)

	$ debuild -us -uc

Once you are happy with the state of the package, just upload it to the PPA:

$ dput ppa:biometrics/bob <source.changes>
