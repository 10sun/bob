* pybob_visioner does not seem to depend correctly on bob_visioner. If the
  build is run in parallel, it normally fails.
* Remove all group writing (chmod) flags from installation, leave this to the
  build system
* database creation, installation and copying still executed as test - a good
  thing would be to have independent targets for this. Problems to solve:
  testing db functionality will not work?
  * Database can now be operated with a single command. After building and
    installing, the user must download the databases using the command
    "dbmanage.py all download ..." This is only a partial solution to the
    problem.
  * You can now use the target "install-database-download" or 
  "install-database-create to force downloading of databases.
  * Still unsolved: how to pin the database versions to be downloaded?
* Installation:
  * have not verified if we can still compile C++ external code against Bob. A
    recipe is required somewhere.
