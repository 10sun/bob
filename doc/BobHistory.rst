 History
=========

Bob has distant roots on `Torch 3 vision`_, a variant of `Torch`_, a framework
for machine learning, initially developed at the Idiap Research Institute in
Martigny, Wallis, Switzerland. It diverged from `Torch`_ in its early infancy
to become a completely independent project, focused primarily on tools for
Biometrics and Forensics, Machine Learning and Signal Processing.
