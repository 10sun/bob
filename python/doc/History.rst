History
-------

|project| has distant roots from `Torch 3 vision`_, a variant of `Torch`_, which
was/is a framework for machine learning, initially developed at the Idiap Research
Institute in Switzerland. It diverged from `Torch`_ in its infancy to become a 
completely independent project focused primarily on tools for biometrics, forensics, 
machine learning and signal processing. Here are some links to older versions of 
``Torch`` that served as an inspiration:

* `Torch 3`_
* `Torch 3 Vision`_
* `Torch 5`_
