   * The ipLBPTop class is designed to calculate the LBP-Top coefficients given
   * a set of images. 
   *
   * The workflow is as follows:
   * 1. You initialize the class, defining the radius and number of points in
   * each of the three directions: XY, XT, YT for the LBP calculations
   * 2. For each image you have in the frame sequence, you push into the class
   * 3. An internal FIFO queue (length = radius in T direction) keeps track 
   * of the current image and their order. As a new image is pushed in, the
   * oldest on the queue is pushed out. 
   * 4. After pushing an image, you read the current LBP-Top coefficients and
   * may save it somewhere.
