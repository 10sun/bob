======================
 Installing |project|
======================

The easiest way to start using |project| in your scripts, is to find a
pre-packaged binary version ready that is ready to install for your platform.
Packaging is constantly being revised and updated - even for a given
release of |project|. We may add new installation methods or update/outdate
packages and dependencies as we sediment deployment of a release. To find the
latest available binary installation methods, please visit `our package
installation wiki <https://github.com/idiap/bob/wiki/Packages>`_. 

On the other hand, if the supported binary installation methods are not
appropriate or you would like to become a developer of |project|, you should
compile |project| yourself as explained at :doc:`Compilation`.
